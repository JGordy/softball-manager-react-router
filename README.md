# Softball Manager

A web application for managing your softball team, schedule, and player availability.

## Built With

This project is a full-stack React application built with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) and leverages the following technologies:

- **Framework:** [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for server-side rendering, data loading/mutations, and routing.
- **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized builds.
- **Backend:** [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) as a self-hosted backend-as-a-service for user authentication, database, and storage.
- **UI Components:** [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/) for a rich set of accessible and themeable React components.
- **Icons:** [Tabler Icons](https://tabler-icons.io/) for a consistent and modern icon set.
- **Styling:** [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) and [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build in the `build/` directory, with separate client and server bundles. You can then use the `start` script to run the production server.

```bash
npm run start
```
